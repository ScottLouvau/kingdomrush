# Kingdom Rush Animator and AI Scanner

This repo contains the code for the Kingdom Rush Animator and AI Scanner hosted at https://relentlessoptimizer.com/KR.

I've defined a "chess-like" [Kingdom Rush syntax](https://relentlessoptimizer.com/KR/help/#kingdom-rush-syntax) to transcribe my games, plan on paper, and enable animating a playthrough.

```

G7 Arti3
E9 Barr2

# Upgrade provided Arch3 to a Ranger's Hideout
E7 Rang
E7 Pois1

# Redirect to blocking and killing the spiders
G6 Barr
E7 Wrat3
G6 Barr2

# Poison for stronger bandits
E7 Pois2
```

The [Kingdom Rush Animator](https://relentlessoptimizer.com/KR/animate) creates animations like YouTube walkthrough videos, but better. It shows just the build steps, so they're short. The last step is highlighted so you can find it at a glance while playing. Ability upgrades are drawn next to the towers, so you can't miss them. You can watch the animations like a video or tap through them like a slideshow as you play.

The [AI-powered scanner](https://relentlessoptimizer.com/KR/scan/) takes in gameplay videos and transcribes them in the syntax for you.
